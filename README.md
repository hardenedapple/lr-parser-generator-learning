# Ignore this repository.

This is simply a python playground I wrote during a holiday because I didn't
have my usual development environment and couldn't do usual stuff.

Tried learning to write LR(1) and SLR parser generators from some tutorials on
the internet.

Tutorials I used are:
https://boxbase.org/entries/2019/oct/14/lr1-parsing-tables/
and
https://serokell.io/blog/how-to-implement-lr1-parser
 (n.b. I *believe* that the second tutorial is actually talking about
 implementing an SLR(1) parser -- got confused until I saw it like that).
